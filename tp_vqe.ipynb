    "# Variational quantum eigensolver (VQE)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note: The TP is in english, but feel free to answer questions in french **\n",
    "\n",
    "The purpose of this TP is to introduce a new concept in quantum algorithmics: variational quantum eigensolving (VQE).\n",
    "This class of algorithms tries to tackle the following problem:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Problem\n",
    "\n",
    "**Input**: some Hamiltonian $H$\n",
    "\n",
    "**Output**: the ground energy $E_0$ of $H$ (or at least an approximation of it)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "You should already be familiar with the Quantum Phase Estimation algorithm (QPE) that partly solves this problem\n",
    "\n",
    "## VQE algorithm\n",
    "\n",
    "The approach taken in a VQE algorithm is less resource demanding than a full QPE and relies on the following structure:\n",
    "\n",
    "- pick a family of quantum states $|\\psi(\\theta)\\rangle$, parametrized by a collection of angles $\\theta = (\\theta_1, ..., \\theta_k)$\n",
    "- use a classical optimizer and a quantum computer to find $\\theta^\\star = arg min_\\theta \\langle \\psi(\\theta) | H | \\psi(\\theta) \\rangle$.\n",
    "- output $\\langle \\psi(\\theta^\\star) | H | \\psi(\\theta^\\star) \\rangle$\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "This type of approach assumes several things:\n",
    "- first, we need an *interesting* family of quantum states $|\\psi(\\theta)\\rangle$. In particular, we are looking for states that:\n",
    "    - can be prepared efficiently. That is, we have a simple quantum circuit $C(\\theta)$ such that $|\\psi(\\theta)\\rangle = C(\\theta)|0\\rangle$ \n",
    "    - can approximate faithfully the ground state of $H$. That is, there exists some $\\theta^*$ such that $|\\psi(\\theta^\\star)\\rangle \\approx |GS\\rangle$\n",
    "\n",
    "- second, we need to be able to efficiently use a quantum computer to evaluate the quantify $\\langle \\psi(\\theta)|H|\\psi(\\theta)\\rangle$. This is usually enforced by having $H = \\sum_i \\alpha_i P_i$ where $P_i$ are Pauli operators and the sum is not too large.\n",
    "\n",
    "## This TP\n",
    "\n",
    "In this TP, we will consider a very standard class of Hamiltonian called Ising Hamiltonians.\n",
    "The motivation being that they can naturally encode many combinatorial optimization problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will pick the following convention for our Hamiltonians:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ H = \\sum_{1 \\leq i < j \\leq n} J_{i, j} \\sigma_z^i \\sigma_z^j $$\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Notice two things (that might differ from standard definitions):\n",
    "- the sum runs over pairs $(i, j)$ of spins where $i < j$\n",
    "- there is not *magnetic field* term, only coupling terms\n",
